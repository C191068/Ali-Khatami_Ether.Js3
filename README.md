# Ali_Khatami_Ether.JS3

### Tiny JavaScript Refresher

```javascript

console.log("Khatami");

```

it will print the following

Figure1: After writing the above code in our .js file when we typed ```deploy akrkdeploy.js``` at terminal<br>
 it will print the above <br>

 Here we have use the word ```node``` means we want to run the above javascript code using node.js <br>
 ```node``` is used for running backend Javascript code <br>

 ```uint256 variable =5``` in Solidity is same as that of ```let variable = 5``` of Javascript <br>

```javascript

console.log("Khatami");

let variable = 5;

console.log(variable);

```


The above code will print the following:

 Figure2: When we click ```node``` then clik ```ak``` then click the ```Tab``` button and click ```Enter``` button


 ```javascript

function main() {
  console.log("Khatami");

  let variable = 5;

  console.log(variable);
}

```

the above code will give the following no output

 Figure3: It is because we have wrapped the whole code in a function and want something to call the function <br>

 ```javascript

function main() {
  console.log("Khatami");

  let variable = 5;

  console.log(variable);
}

main();

```

the above code will give the following output <br>

Solidity is an example of ```synchronous``` programming language. <br>

Synchronous programming language means where one line gets executed one after another <br>

 ```javascript

function main() {
  console.log("Khatami");

  let variable = 5;

  console.log(variable);
}

main();

```


In the above code after calling of the ```main()``` function other lines of code gets executed one after another <br>
