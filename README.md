# Ali_Khatami_Ether.JS3

### Tiny JavaScript Refresher

```javascript

console.log("Khatami");

```

it will print the following
![e59](https://github.com/C191068/Ali-Khatami_Ether.Js3/assets/89090776/f53a93da-7537-4121-9817-ba575a158e9c)
Figure1: After writing the above code in our .js file when we typed ```deploy akrkdeploy.js``` at terminal<br>
 it will print the above <br>

 Here we have use the word ```node``` means we want to run the above javascript code using node.js <br>
 ```node``` is used for running backend Javascript code <br>

 ```uint256 variable =5``` in Solidity is same as that of ```let variable = 5``` of Javascript <br>

```javascript

console.log("Khatami");

let variable = 5;

console.log(variable);

```


The above code will print the following:

 Figure2: When we click ```node``` then clik ```ak``` then click the ```Tab``` button and click ```Enter``` button


 ```javascript

function main() {
  console.log("Khatami");

  let variable = 5;

  console.log(variable);
}

```

the above code will give the following no output

 Figure3: It is because we have wrapped the whole code in a function and want something to call the function <br>

 ```javascript

function main() {
  console.log("Khatami");

  let variable = 5;

  console.log(variable);
}

main();

```

the above code will give the following output <br>

Solidity is an example of ```synchronous``` programming language but there will be some exceptions when <br>
working with Oracles <br>



Synchronous programming language means where one line gets executed one after another <br>

 ```javascript

function main() {
  console.log("Khatami");

  let variable = 5;

  console.log(variable);
}

main();

```


In the above code after calling of the ```main()``` function other lines of code gets executed one after another <br>


Javascript is an asynchronous programming language because while waiting for one line code to get executed<br>
we can have another code to get executed <br>

example of synchronous programming throug a sentence:

Mr Ali have arrnge dinner party by inviting frinds in his house. His mother is cooking fried chickens.<br>
Until the fried chicken is cooked he waits. Then he pour drinking water from bottle to glass. Then serve the food and start<br<
the dinner party <br>


example of asynchronous programming throug a sentence:

Mr Ali have arrnge dinner party by inviting frinds in his house. His mother is cooking fried chickens.<br>
He does not wait until the fried chicken is cooked thus he pour drinking water from bottle to glass.<br>
After the fried chicken is cooked <br>
Then serve the food and start<br>
the dinner party <br>
